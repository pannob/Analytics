# Philip's Projects

# 1) PYTHON_SQL_CW.ipynb (Basics/Introduction)

This project required given data to be: Cleaned, Formatted, Stored and Modified.
- Renamed Columns
- Dealt with missing values
- Removed Duplicates
- Standardised Columns
- Stored Cleaned Databases' in SQL
- Used random integers to select rows to modify
- Mainly used pandas and numpy to resolve issues, some functions made

# 2) rstudio_statics.pdf (Statistical Analysis and Visualisation using R)
- Simple Linear Regression, fit log models, confidance and prediction bands
- Multiple Regression, created histogram for player performance, created poisson model, used p-values to perform likelihood ratio test
- Lasso + Logistic Regression, created test/train data to fit logistic model using glmnet, cross-validation to choose model, ROC curves to summarise findings, found youdens index and calculated confusion matricies, sensitivity and specificity as a function of a column are calculated and plotted on bars to analyse effectiveness of predictions

# 3 machine_learning_cw.pdf (Machine Learning task using python)
## google colab links available at the end of the pdf file
- using absenteeism at work dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository developed machine learning pipeline to predict employee absenteeism
